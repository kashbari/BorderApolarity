### General Info
***
Implementation of Border Apolarity Algorithm of Conner/Harper/Landsberg using
SageMath. Batch computing used to compute the many candidates. Used
computational cluster with SLURM as workload manager. Results will be cleaned
up and more streamlined in future.
## Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
* [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/): Version <9.0 
Recommend Installing LinBox as well.
